  <p1>This is my technical portfolio, so I have included a link to my <a href = "https://github.com/chandlerg1224">github account</a>, which has
  some of the things I have done for school. One of the projects not included on my github is a game engine I created in c++ from scratch with 
the help of youtube of course. I have also created a discord bot that monitors chats with the help of this
<a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv24S2L1N0k">video</a> and this 
<a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ih20l3pJoeU">video</a> for the graphics engine. I have also attempted to make a game before but I ended up not 
finishing it.</p1>
