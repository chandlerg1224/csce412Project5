  <p1>Welcome to my website, my name is Chandler Gerold and this is my website for CSCE315. 
    I am 21 years old and a junior at Texas A&M University. 
  </p1>
    <h2>About me</h2> 
    <div class = "p2">
    Something I am interested in is game development. I have built my own game engine, with the help of youtube of course and I have made a simple game within it as well. Even though I am interested in game 
    development, I won’t be starting my career 
    as a game developer. For my entire life I have been super into video games and I feel like that is what drove me 
    into computer science in the first place, and that’s probably why I am drawn to game development. 
    But, honestly I don’t see myself in that field with how much crunch time they are expected to endure 
    to meet deadlines. That aspect of the field is a massive deterrent for me. I would much rather 
    have more time outside of work to do what I please instead of working too much. Instead, I am going to work with sql, c#, and a little bit of python at a company called Nucore 
    Corporation. I am looking forward to working at Nucore because what they do is super interesting to me as well. They have an application that helps companies do risk analysis 
    and track their trades while trading energy. I have interned for them before and it was really cool and I learned a lot. In the 
    beginning, I didn’t really know what to expect and they made it very easy for me to learn everything. They 
    were always available for questions and I am excited to return  
    this coming summer. I am most likely going to end up working there after school as 
    well. I'm really looking forward to finally being done with school and joining the workforce. Also, I think 
    I will enjoy working there and that is super important to me, as I would be miserable for a large portion of the day and I don't want that.</div>
