  <p1>I haven't really done much giving back to the community. I have only done small things like pick up trash here and there
    and given some food one or two homeless people. In the future, I plan on giving back more in a myriad of ways. I hope to donate money to charity and 
    help people if I end up having the privilege to do so. Also, I probably will join an organization or something similar to help give back to my community.
