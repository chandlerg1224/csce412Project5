       <p1>My qualifications include my computer science degree I will soon be earning, I have had an internship at a company called nucore,
        and I have experience with some projects in my freetime. The company I interned at (nucore corporation) was building an app with c# and the database was made with sql. Most of the work that 
        I did was creating the models and the dtos 
        that interacted with the data from sql in c#. I also created some tables and filled them with the required data in sql.
        Some of the projects that I have attempted and completed will be included in my technical portfolio.
    Also, I have experience with a few languages such 
    as <a href = "https://cplusplus.com/">c++</a>, 
    <a href = "https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/">c#</a>, 
    <a href = "https://www.mysql.com/">SQL</a>,
